# MTG inventory

This project is the front end piece for building an MTG inventory. 

## Why?

I really liked deckbox.org, however it was limited in the fact that you can't add graded or sealed product to your inventory. As state from the project the primary goal is focused around a great inventory management system first. Then other features later.

I really just wanted to create an inventory management system that was dependent on what I wanted vs what the others give you. I also wanted it to be mobile first.

### Planned Features

Most of the planned features will be added to a trello board to keep track of progress.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
